//! Low-level polynomial arithmetic for ML-DSA.
//!
//! Routines whose bit-level behaviour depends on a variant parameter (ETA,
//! GAMMA1, GAMMA2, TAU) take it as a const generic and select the matching
//! code path with a constant condition, which monomorphization folds away.
//! Unsupported parameter values fail at compile time.
//!
//! # Coefficient-bound contract
//!
//! The routines in this module are ports of the reference ML-DSA
//! implementation. For performance and constant-time behaviour they do **not**
//! re-validate their inputs; instead each function documents the coefficient
//! bounds it requires and the bounds its output satisfies. Violating a
//! precondition can overflow `i32` arithmetic — a panic in builds with
//! overflow checks, silent wraparound (and a corrupt polynomial) in release
//! builds.
//!
//! To keep those preconditions from being violated by *external* callers,
//! [`Poly`] seals its coefficient array:
//!
//! - [`Poly::from_coeffs`] is the validated entry point for untrusted data; it only accepts
//!   coefficients in `(-Q, Q)`, which satisfies every precondition of the **public** routines in
//!   this module. Routines with narrower preconditions (`shiftl`, whose bound is `|c| < 2^(31-D)`)
//!   are `pub(crate)` so they cannot be reached with boundary-validated data; their internal
//!   callers guarantee the bounds by construction.
//! - The unpack functions (`z_unpack`, `eta_unpack`, …) produce bounded coefficients by
//!   construction.
//! - [`Poly::coeffs_mut`] grants raw mutable access and shifts responsibility for the documented
//!   bounds to the caller. It exists for advanced integrations (e.g. threshold signing) that
//!   maintain the invariants themselves.
//!
//! Preconditions are additionally checked with `debug_assert!` so misuse fails
//! loudly in tests without costing anything in release builds.
//!
//! The following must not compile — external code cannot funnel
//! boundary-validated coefficients into `shiftl`'s narrower domain:
//!
//! ```compile_fail
//! use qp_rusty_crystals_dilithium::{params, poly::{self, Poly}};
//!
//! let mut coeffs = [0i32; 256];
//! coeffs[0] = params::Q - 1; // accepted by from_coeffs, outside shiftl's domain
//! let mut p = Poly::from_coeffs(coeffs).unwrap();
//! poly::shiftl(&mut p); // error: `shiftl` is crate-private
//! ```
