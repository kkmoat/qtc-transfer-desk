//! Regression tests (security review): the key import/serialize paths must
//! not leave plaintext copies of the secret key in dead stack memory.
//!
//! `Keypair::from_bytes` and `SecretKey::from_bytes` built a local
//! `[u8; SECRETKEYBYTES]` copy of the secret key and "moved" it into the
//! returned struct — but `[u8; N]` is `Copy`, so the local survived the move
//! and was never zeroized. `Keypair::to_bytes` materialized a
//! `self.secret.to_bytes()` temporary that was dropped unwiped. (Contrast
//! `Keypair::generate`, which explicitly wipes its `sk` local.) Any of these
//! leaves the full secret key readable in stale stack memory after the live
//! `SecretKey` has been dropped and zeroized.
//!
//! Detection uses the same painted-stack technique as the crate's
//! `stack_probe` example: run the operation on a dedicated sentinel-painted
//! buffer via `psm::on_stack`, then scan the buffer — which we own, so the
//! read is sound — for a distinctive window of the packed secret key. The
//! import scenarios wipe the caller-side result in place; the serialize
//! scenarios simply drop it, since `to_bytes` returns a self-wiping
//! `Zeroizing` buffer. Any surviving match is a copy the library failed to
//! clean up.
//!
//! The scan window is taken from the packed s1 region of the secret key:
//! those bytes only ever appear in this packed form in full serialized-key
//! copies (the unpacked polynomial representation is laid out differently),
//! so a match cannot come from the legitimate, separately-zeroized unpacked
//! intermediates.
//!
//! The assertion is about codegen (move elision, which temporaries get
//! wiped), so it is per-monomorphization: each parameter set has different
//! key-struct frame sizes and can spill differently. The scenario suite is
//! therefore stamped once per enabled ML-DSA variant rather than only
//! binding the ML-DSA-87 instantiation.
//!
//! Only compiled for optimized builds (`cargo test --release`): unoptimized
//! codegen materializes additional compiler-generated move temporaries for
//! the large by-value key structs which no source-level fix can wipe, so a
//! zero-copy assertion is only meaningful once those are elided.
