//! Move-only, zeroize-on-drop wrappers for the Wormhole spend secret.
//!
//! This imitates `SensitiveBytes32` from `qp-rusty-crystals` (see
//! `WormholePair` in the hdwallet crate, which already keeps the secret in
//! such a wrapper). The protection was previously lost at the hand-off into
//! this repository, where the secret degraded into a `Copy` [`BytesDigest`]
//! inside a `Clone`-able `PrivateCircuitInputs`: any move or field access
//! could silently duplicate the spend credential into stack frames, logs, or
//! crash dumps that no drop-time scrub can reach.
//!
//! Two wrappers:
//!
//! - [`Secret`]: the spend secret itself, held by `PrivateCircuitInputs`,
//!   `Nullifier`, and `UnspendableAccount`. Stores the 32-byte form and
//!   exposes either encoding (bytes via [`Secret::expose_digest`], felts via
//!   [`Secret::expose_felts`]).
//! - [`SensitiveFelts`]: a heap buffer of field elements that carries an
//!   exposed secret out of a serialization API.
//!
//! Shared properties:
//!
//! - **Zeroized on drop** via the [`zeroize`] crate, whose writes the
//!   optimizer cannot elide. This crate is `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`, so the
//!   volatile scrubbing lives in that vetted dependency.
//! - **No `Debug`**: a container that derives `Debug` over these fields fails
//!   to compile, forcing a redacting manual impl instead.
//! - [`Secret`] is move-only (no `Clone`): duplication out of the wrapper
//!   requires an explicitly named `expose_*` call, making every copy
//!   searchable and visible in review.
//! - Serialization that must carry an exposed secret returns
//!   [`zeroize::Zeroizing`] / [`SensitiveFelts`] so the heap buffer is
//!   scrubbed when the caller drops it — never a bare `Vec`.
//!
//! # Scope
//!
//! These wrappers cover the copies *we* own. Transient stack copies made
//! while encoding the secret into field elements, and the copies plonky2
//! keeps inside `PartialWitness`/`ProverCircuitData` during proving, are out
//! of scope here (the latter requires upstream support to scrub). One known
//! heap instance: qp-plonky2's `hash_no_pad` (`pad10_to_rate`) copies its
//! input — including the secret preimage — into an internal rate-aligned
//! `Vec` and frees it unscrubbed; see `tests/heap_zeroization.rs`, which
//! exempts exactly that block and catches every leak on our side.
