## 📈 Changelog

### Unreleased
- **Breaking**: `bytes_to_digest`, `bytes_to_felts_compact`, and `rehash_to_bytes` now return `Result`, rejecting 8-byte limbs that encode values `>= P` (non-canonical field encodings that alias with canonical elements and enabled hash collisions)
- Added `bytes_to_digest_lossy`, an explicitly-labelled infallible variant preserving the old reduce-mod-P behavior for callers that intentionally want a lossy commitment over non-field data (e.g. binding Blake2 roots into a Poseidon preimage)
- **Breaking**: `u128_to_quantized_felt` replaced by `try_u128_to_quantized_felt`, which returns `Result` instead of panicking on amounts whose quantized value exceeds 32 bits
- **Breaking**: `u64s_to_digest` now returns `Result`, rejecting limbs that exceed 32 bits instead of silently truncating them (distinct limb arrays could previously alias to the same digest)
- `hash_bytes` and `hash_squeeze_twice` now absorb input incrementally instead of materializing the serialized preimage on the heap (fixes unbounded allocation on attacker-sized inputs)
- Added `bytes_to_felts_iter` / `bytes_to_u64s_iter` for allocation-free streaming of the injective encoding
- Docs: narrowed the constant-time claim — Goldilocks add/sub/reduce contain rare value-dependent correction branches, so dudect results are empirical evidence rather than a branch-free guarantee
- `ct_bench` timed closures now route inputs and outputs through `black_box`, preventing the optimizer from eliding the measured hashing work and silently weakening the timing regression gate

### Version 0.9.1
- Restructured as workspace with separate core and substrate crates
