//! # Wormhole Utilities
//!
//! This module provides functionality for generating and verifying wormhole-based addresses,
//! using Poseidon hashing and a salt-based construction to derive deterministic addresses
//! from secrets or pre-hashed secrets.
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! - A `WormholePair` consists of:
//!     - `address`: a Poseidon-derived `[u8; 32]` address.
//!     - `secret`: a 32-byte Poseidon hash derived from entropy or input secret.
//!
//! - You can:
//!     - Generate new wormhole identities using random entropy (`generate_new`).
//!     - Verify a secret against an address by re-deriving (derivation is deterministic, so re-run
//!       `generate_new` with the same input and compare the resulting `address`).
//!
//! The hashing strategy ensures determinism while hiding the original secret.
//!
//! ## Integration with HD Wallet
//!
//! This module integrates with the HD wallet system by providing specialized address generation
//! for paths that start with "w/". When such paths are encountered, the wallet system uses
//! this module's functionality to generate wormhole addresses instead of regular HD wallet
//! addresses.
//!
//! The wormhole addresses provide an additional layer of privacy and security by using
//! Poseidon hashing, which is particularly well-suited for zero-knowledge proof systems.
