//! Regression test (security review): wormhole address derivation must never
//! free heap memory that still contains the secret.
//!
//! `generate_pair_from_secret` encodes the secret as Goldilocks felts and
//! copies them into a heap-backed `Vec` preimage for Poseidon hashing. That
//! vector used to be `clear()`ed — which resets the length but does not touch
//! the backing allocation — so the felt-encoded secret survived in freed heap
//! memory after the pair's own zeroizing wrappers had done their job.
//!
//! The test installs a global allocator that scans every block for the secret
//! pattern at `dealloc` time (the block is still valid inside the hook, so the
//! scan is sound) and asserts that no secret-bearing block is ever freed while
//! derivation runs. This file contains exactly one test so no unrelated
//! concurrent allocations can race the scanner.
