//! Regression tests (security review): dropped `bip39::Mnemonic` values must
//! not leave the mnemonic's word indices in dead stack memory.
//!
//! `Mnemonic` stores the secret phrase as `words: [u16; 24]` (indices into the
//! public BIP39 word list, so the phrase is trivially reconstructible from
//! them) and only implements `Zeroize`/`ZeroizeOnDrop` when the bip39 crate's
//! `zeroize` feature is enabled. The workspace previously declared bip39 with
//! `default-features = false` and no `zeroize` feature, so the `Mnemonic`
//! locals dropped inside `mnemonic_to_seed` (seed stretching) and
//! `generate_mnemonic` left the full word-index buffer in dead stack frames.
//!
//! Detection uses the same painted-stack technique as the other
//! `*_stack_zeroization` tests: run the operation on a sentinel-painted buffer
//! via `psm::on_stack`, then scan the buffer — which we own, so the read is
//! sound — for the native-endian byte image of the expected word-index array.
//!
//! The assertion is about codegen (which temporaries get wiped), so it is only
//! compiled for optimized builds (`cargo test --release`): unoptimized codegen
//! materializes additional compiler-generated move temporaries that no
//! source-level fix can wipe.
