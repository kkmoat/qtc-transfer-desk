//! Regression test (security review): the 32 bytes of derived keypair
//! entropy must not survive in dead stack memory after key generation.
//!
//! The entropy is the crown jewel of the pipeline: it deterministically
//! yields the entire keypair. It previously crossed three function
//! boundaries by value — `derive_entropy_from_seed`'s return,
//! `Keypair::generate`'s parameter, and `keypair_var`'s parameter (which
//! additionally unwrapped it into a raw array via `into_bytes()`). Rust
//! moves are copies that leave the moved-from stack slot dead but never
//! dropped, so `ZeroizeOnDrop` could not wipe those slots. The fixed
//! pipeline fills a caller-owned `SensitiveBytes32` in place and lends it
//! to key generation by reference, which wipes it in place after use.
//!
//! Detection uses the same painted-stack technique as the other
//! `*_stack_zeroization` tests; see `hderive_stack_zeroization.rs`.
//!
//! The assertion is about codegen (which temporaries get wiped), so it is
//! only compiled for optimized builds (`cargo test --release`).
