//! Proof pool for delegated (public-batch) aggregation.
//!
//! A miner-facing, in-memory pool of private-batch proofs received from
//! untrusted clients. Proofs are cryptographically verified on admission and
//! bucketed by the metadata the public-batch circuit constrains across a batch
//! (block hash, asset id, volume fee), so every bucket is aggregatable by
//! construction: the "when to aggregate which bucket" decision is left to the
//! operator's policy, fed by [`BucketStats`].
//!
//! # Custody: the pool may be a proof's only holder
//!
//! A miner runs this pool over proofs pulled from the node's transaction pool
//! or intercepted from gossip before it — and a miner aggregating a proof for
//! the reward has every incentive NOT to relay it further (it is claiming the
//! proof for its own batch). A pooled proof must therefore be treated as
//! possibly existing nowhere else in the network until it settles, so the
//! pool never gives up custody for proving:
//!
//! [`ProofPool::snapshot_batch`] CLONES the oldest `batch_size` proofs of a
//! bucket; the originals stay pooled. Prove the snapshot without holding any
//! pool lock (public-batch proving is tens of seconds, i.e. a few block
//! times), submit the result, and let the on-chain settlement retire the
//! proved inputs through the regular [`ProofPool::evict_settled`] cadence. A
//! failed or crashed proving attempt needs no recovery protocol: the pool
//! never changed. The paths that remove a proof are settlement eviction,
//! expiry ([`ProofPool::evict_older_than`]), and the explicit operator
//! override [`ProofPool::remove_bucket`].
//!
//! Buckets queue arbitrarily deep (bounded only by [`PoolLimits`]), so a hot
//! (block, asset, fee) stream keeps admitting while earlier batches are being
//! proved.
//!
//! Staleness: a queued proof becomes worthless once any of its nullifiers is
//! settled on-chain (e.g. another miner included the same private batch, or a
//! public batch containing it — including this miner's own submissions).
//! Operators should call [`ProofPool::evict_settled`] with newly settled
//! nullifiers on every imported block — both before proving (don't aggregate
//! dead weight) and before submitting a finished public batch (don't submit
//! stale segments). Until a submitted batch settles, its bucket remains
//! snapshot-able; use [`BucketStats::last_snapshot_age`] to skip buckets with
//! a submission plausibly still in flight instead of re-proving them every
//! policy cycle (a full public-batch prove is tens of seconds of CPU).
//!
//! Expiry: settlement is the only AUTOMATIC drain, and it only ever sees
//! nullifiers that reach the chain. A proof that never settles — its miner
//! lost the inclusion race and the referenced block fell out of the pallet's
//! acceptance window — would otherwise stay resident forever, permanently
//! consuming [`PoolLimits::max_proofs`] (which is the whole memory bound).
//! Operators MUST therefore run an expiry policy: either call
//! [`ProofPool::evict_older_than`] on a cadence with an age comfortably past
//! the chain's acceptance window, or implement their own via
//! [`ProofPool::remove_bucket`].
//!
//! Note on nullifier checks: the pool-wide duplicate-nullifier rejection at
//! admission and `evict_settled` are OPERATIONAL, not security-critical. They
//! keep the miner from wasting proving time on batches the chain would refuse
//! and prevent duplicate-based capacity DoS. The actual double-spend boundary
//! is the wormhole pallet's persistent settled-nullifier set, which settles
//! each nullifier at most once regardless of what any aggregator pools or
//! submits. See "Nullifiers and Double-Spend Prevention" in
//! `wormhole/README.md`.
//!
//! Note on dummies: an all-dummy private-batch proof (all-zero block hash) is
//! REJECTED at admission even though it can be cryptographically valid. It
//! settles nothing and only expiry could ever reclaim it (aggregating it is
//! refused, and `evict_settled` never sees its random nullifiers on-chain),
//! so pooling it would let an attacker occupy global capacity with dead
//! entries for a full expiry window at a time. Public-batch padding does
//! not need pooled dummies either: the prover pads from its own pinned dummy
//! template.
