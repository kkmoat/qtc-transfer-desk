//! Delegated (public-batch) aggregation service.
//!
//! [`PublicBatchAggregator`] is the miner-facing component: it pools
//! private-batch proofs received from untrusted clients (admission-verified and
//! bucketed by batch compatibility, see [`crate::pool`]) and aggregates one
//! bucket at a time into a public-batch proof bound to this aggregator's
//! address.
//!
//! Client-side (private-batch) aggregation intentionally has no queue: a client
//! knows its own full leaf set up front, so it uses
//! [`PrivateBatchProver::aggregate`](crate::private_batch::prover::PrivateBatchProver::aggregate)
//! directly.
//!
//! # Concurrency
//!
//! Public-batch proving takes tens of seconds (~16 s for a 53-proof batch on
//! Apple-Silicon-class hardware; a few block times, so settlements can land
//! mid-prove). [`PublicBatchAggregator::aggregate`] is the simple blocking
//! convenience; a service that must keep admitting proofs while proving
//! should snapshot under a short lock and prove without it:
//!
//! ```text
//! // policy loop, short exclusive lock (snapshot_batch takes &mut self —
//! // it records the snapshot time, so racing policy workers see each
//! // other's mark instead of both proving the same key). Capture the OWNED
//! // proving context under the same short lock, then drop the guard:
//! let (proofs, prover) = {
//!     let mut guard = aggregator.lock();
//!     (guard.snapshot_batch(&key)?, guard.proving_context())
//! }; // guard dropped HERE — admission, eviction, and policy keep running
//!
//! // proving worker, NO lock held — the context owns clones of the
//! // artifacts pinned at construction (never re-reads the mutable
//! // bins_dir), so it can be moved to the worker outright:
//! let proof = prover.prove_batch(proofs)?;
//! // submit `proof`; the block-import evict_settled cadence retires the
//! // proved inputs from the pool once their segments settle on-chain.
//! ```
//!
//! Do NOT call [`PublicBatchAggregator::prove_batch`] through the lock
//! (`aggregator.lock().prove_batch(proofs)`): it borrows the aggregator, so
//! the temporary guard lives until proving returns, blocking every other
//! aggregator user for the full proving window.
//!
//! Proving is NON-CONSUMING: the snapshot is a clone and the pooled originals
//! stay put, because a claiming miner's pool may hold the only copy of a
//! proof in the network (see the custody section in [`crate::pool`]). A
//! failed or crashed proving worker therefore needs no recovery protocol —
//! the pool never changed — and buckets queue deeper than one batch, so
//! admissions for the same key keep landing while it is being proved.
//!
//! Because success does not drain the bucket, a policy loop must NOT blindly
//! re-aggregate the same key every cycle: until settlement lands (a few
//! block times), each re-prove burns a full proving run to produce a
//! duplicate submission. Use [`BucketStats::last_snapshot_age`] to skip
//! buckets with a submission plausibly still in flight.
//!
//! The removal paths are settlement eviction
//! ([`PublicBatchAggregator::evict_settled`], call it on every imported
//! block), expiry ([`PublicBatchAggregator::evict_older_than`] — operators
//! MUST run it, or their own expiry policy, on a cadence; see the expiry
//! section in [`crate::pool`]), and the operator override
//! [`PublicBatchAggregator::remove_bucket`].
