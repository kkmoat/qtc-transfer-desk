# qp-wormhole-aggregator

Aggregates multiple Wormhole ZK proofs into a single proof (tree aggregation).

Takes a batch of leaf proofs from the Wormhole circuit and produces one aggregated proof via a configurable tree (branching factor and depth). Uses [qp-wormhole-circuit], [qp-wormhole-prover], and [qp-wormhole-verifier] under the hood.

Artifact directories are assumed to come from **CI-attested builds** on a trusted
host. Trust boundaries (what is in vs out of scope for audits) are in
[`../THREAT_MODEL.md`](../THREAT_MODEL.md).
